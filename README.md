# MobileTogether-Solar-Power-Tool
This app lets users record solar panel production and electricity consumption data for net-meter billing and produces various charts to illustrate the data and track the surplus over time.

Many residential solar generation systems connect to the utility power grid with net-zero billing. Solar panels installed on the roof provide power to the home only while the sun is shining. Electricity comes from the grid at night or whenever demand exceeds production.

When the system produces more electricity than the home consumes, the excess is fed back to the grid and supplements utility generation capacity. 

A system for any home is initially configured based on a historical year of electricity consumption. During months with more sunshine and less electricity demand, the account builds a surplus that is drawn down when demand exceeds generation.

These homes typically have two electric meters. One records electricity produced, and the other records electricity consumed. 

This app demonstrates several advanced features of Altova MobileTogether: charts with layers and dynamic XPath settings, sub pages as modal dialogs, scrollable tables, send email with file attachments, automatic support for Dark Theme, and more.
